v0.10.0 - Hearts, Hearts, and... Mehs
##########################################
* CHECKPOINTS!
    + Touch a checkpoint flag to lock in 
    your progress. If you die in the level 
    you'll respawn at the last checkpoint 
    you activated. 
    + No hard limit right now to the 
    number of checkpoints. 
    + Need to restart the level? Select 
    "RETRY FROM FLAG" from the pause menu,
    wow!
* Extra Hit Hearts
    + Pick one of these up for a bit of 
    security.
    + If you take normal damage, you'll 
    get two seconds of invulnerability 
    before you can take damage again. 
    + NOTE: lava, bottom of screen, air 
    depletion and skull blocks cause insta
    death, so be careful!
* Clear checks have been implemented!
    + Uploaded levels begin with a status
    of "pending clear check"
    + At this point it won't be available
    for others to play, but will be safe
    on the cloud
    + Play a pending level from the 
    "Uploaded Levels" tab in "My Levels"
    to clear check it
    + If you beat a pending level, its 
    status changes to "ready to publish"
    + Levels in "ready" state are still 
    not visible to others
    + Once a level is ready to publish,
    click "Publish Level" from the 
    "Uploaded Levels" tab
* Likes and dislikes!
    + Beat a level, then leave feedback.
    + In the future level completion 
    won't be required. 
* Added the ability to slide down slopes 
    by pressing down
* Added the ability to delete levels 
    + This can't be undone, so maybe pull 
    it into the editor to make a copy
    first?
* Added more detailed information to the 
    level cards in Recent Levels
* And some bug fixes 
    + Fixed Hoggle's name not showing 
    correctly in the editor
    + Fixed Hoggle being able to ascend
    walls while running right
    + EXIT button in editor now returns 
    you to the previous menu, instead of 
    always going back to the title screen 
    + Fixed rolling snail shells sometimes
    falling through semisolids

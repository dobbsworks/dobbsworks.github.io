v0.12.0 - Some Light Camera Action
##########################################
* Camera Lock
    + Use Camera Horizontal Locks to keep
    the camera from freely scrolling
    + Can be used to make a series of 
    one-screen rooms, for instance
    + If there's no physical wall where 
    the camera lock is, the player can 
    Megaman their way into the next screen 
* Autoscroll Triggers
    + When an autoscroll trigger is on 
    screen, the camera stops following 
    the player and starts moving on its 
    own 
    + Stack multiples to increase the 
    scroll speed (base 0.8 tiles/second)
    + Player can be killed by getting 
    stuck against the moving camera edge 
* Zoom Triggers 
    + When a zoom trigger is on screen, 
    the camera will zoom in or out up to 
    a predefined limit
    + Use this to make areas feel more 
    open or claustrophobic! 
* New enemy - Yufo
    + Bounces back and forth, occasionally
    pausing to fire a laser downward
    + Jump on it to flip it over, 
    exposing a very bouncy underside!

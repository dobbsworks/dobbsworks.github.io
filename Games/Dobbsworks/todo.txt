    magic stopwatch - hold a clock or hourglass item thing and then all other sprite update functions only get called once per X frames or something
        issue here: platforms are really rough to land on if they're moving, is that true when they're full speed?
        many enemy animations are map frameNum based
        can't just reduce velocity because of enemy internal timers

v0.12.0 - Some Light Camera Action
##########################################
* Camera Lock
    + Use Camera Horizontal Locks to keep
    the camera from freely scrolling
    + Can be used to make a series of 
    one-screen rooms, for instance
    + If there's no physical wall where 
    the camera lock is, the player can 
    Megaman their way into the next screen 
* Autoscroll Triggers
    + When an autoscroll trigger is on 
    screen, the camera stops following 
    the player and starts moving on its 
    own 
    + Stack multiples to increase the 
    scroll speed (base 0.8 tiles/second)
    + Player can be killed by getting 
    stuck against the moving camera edge 
* Zoom Triggers 
    + When a zoom trigger is on screen, 
    the camera will zoom in or out up to 
    a predefined limit
    + Use this to make areas feel more 
    open or claustrophobic! 
* New enemy - Yufo
    + Bounces back and forth, occasionally
    pausing to fire a laser downward
    + Jump on it to flip it over, 
    exposing a very bouncy underside!

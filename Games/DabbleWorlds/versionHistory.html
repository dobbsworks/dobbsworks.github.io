        New features
        <ul>

            <li>Added player-only and sprite-only solid blocks! Look for the yellow blocks in the gadgets tab</li>
            <li>Added sprite-killers! This gadget will destroy any non-player sprites that overlap it (yes, even that weird one that you just thought of)</li>
            <li>Added indicator arrows! Eight directions, available in the gadgets tab. Purely decorative, no functionality</li>

        Interface improvements
        <ul>

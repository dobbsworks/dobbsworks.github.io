				<p>
					TeamFantastik is a team filled with creative makers that love making fun levels with a mixture of
					shell
					tricks and fun platforming in a "RomHack" style. Our team welcomes anyone who loves to build or play
					levels that are well-made, intuitive, and fun to play.

				<div class="panel-header">Get Registered</div>
				<p>
					Anyone can play and enjoy these Fantastik levels, but if you want to start tracking your clears and
					climbing the leaderboard, you'll need to get registered on <a class="discord-link"
						href="https://discord.gg/xdnTAuCMcr" target="_blank">the Discord</a>. Head on over to the
					#registration channel and use the command <code>!register MAK-ERC-ODE</code>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="panel small drop-shadow">
				<div class="panel-header">Find levels</div>
				<p>In the #bot-spam channel, type <code>!random 0.5</code> to get a hand-picked warm-up level. Once
					you've cleared it, use <code>!clear LEV-ELC-ODE</code> to let us know you've cleared it. Add
					<code>like</code> to the command to let us know it's a great course. That's it!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="panel small drop-shadow">
				<div class="panel-header">Submit levels</div>
				<p>When you feel like you have a good feel for what makes a level Fantastik, you can submit your own!
					Make sure to read through #level-rules and #banned-tech before submitting, then head over to
					#submit-levels. To get your level submitted for review, use
					<code>!add STYLE LEV-ELC-ODE My level name</code> (where STYLE is SMB, SMB3, etc.).
